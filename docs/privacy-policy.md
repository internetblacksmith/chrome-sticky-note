# Privacy Policy for Tab Sticky Notes

**Last Updated:** February 27, 2026

## What Data We Store

Tab Sticky Notes stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API:

- **Note content** — the text you type in sticky notes
- **Note position** — coordinates on the page
- **Page URL** — hostname and pathname, used to associate notes with the correct page
- **Pin state** — whether a note is pinned

No data is collected, transmitted, or stored on external servers. The extension makes no network requests.

## How Data Is Used

Stored data is used to display your notes on the correct page and restore them between page reloads and browser sessions.

## Data Sharing

None. No data leaves your device. No third parties have access to your data.

## Data Retention

- Unpinned notes are deleted when the tab is closed
- Pinned notes persist until you delete them manually
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data

## Your Rights

You can view, modify, or delete any note at any time by interacting with it directly on the page. Uninstalling the extension erases all stored data. There is no data on any server to request deletion of.

For users in the EU/EEA: the legal basis for local storage is legitimate interest (providing the functionality you installed the extension for). Since all data is local to your device, you already have full control over access, correction, and deletion.

## Limited Use Disclosure

Tab Sticky Notes' use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the [Chrome Web Store User Data Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-faq), including the Limited Use requirements.

## Changes to This Policy

Updates will be reflected in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing. The "Last Updated" date above will change.
